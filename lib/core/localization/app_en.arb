  "personalDescription": "I graduated with a Bachelor's in ICT & Software Engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I am a quick learner, hardworking, flexible, friendly, and social. As a professional software developer with good communication skills, I am easy to work with. My skills allow me to work both individually and within a team. Additionally, I have an appetite for learning new technologies and programming languages since every technology has its specific use and place. Professional software engineers mustn’t only write quality code and have an in-depth understanding of a technology. A true professional is a person who coaches, provides assistance, and leads by example, not by demand. A good team leader helps team members to become leaders themselves.",
